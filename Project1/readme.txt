Description:
	This program reads records from a text file, parses those records, copies the data from the records
	into a student structure, and creates a hash table of the valid student structures. It contains
	error checking and handling as well.

Extra Credit:
	I did not attempt the extra credit.

Experience:
	This project was very tough and I would not have been able to complete it without the help you provided.
	I am very grateful for your divine intervention! For about a week I had been dealing with multiple bugs
	in this program but there was one that lingered all the way until the very last day which was the corruption
	of the email, credit, and gpa values of the student structures after they had been copied into the hash table.
	You may remember our emails back and forth on the subject but the problem boiled down to me changing the 
	type of the createStudent() function from student to student* when I had just started writing the program.
	I still don't know why I did that but it gave me several headaches and plenty of stress.

Shortcomings:
	I believe there are no shortcomings. I have tested my program with both input files on the course server
	and the output looked good to me.
